# CUE
###### Console User Environment

CUE aims to be a modern and intuitive text-mode interface for use on high resolution consoles. It is aimed at computer veterans and “non-techies”* alike for daily desktop computing tasks.

It takes inspiration from well designed text mode systems over the last 40 years, to create a fast user interface that is not reliant on a mouse or typing commands. A positive side effect is that this will open up headless, and other non graphical machines to all users, without the intimidation of a blank command line.
